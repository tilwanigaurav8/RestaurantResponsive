The project Restaurant responsive is my second personal project. This is quite underdeveloped and is in the development phase. I have plan to 
integrate some js files to make it more good. The centre of attration of this project is its responsiveness. If you use mobile then also you
will have a better UI, the hamburger menu. I am open to work with any developer helping me in JavaScript.
